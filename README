What is it?
-----------
Zantastico is an open-source package deployment tool which quickly and effeciently will copy a wide range of open-source web scripts to your hosting enviroment and then re-direct you to the installer to enable you to personalise your setup! By using Zantastico you save time and bandwidth by not needing to upload large web scripts to your hosting envioment. Admins can easily add additional packages to be deployed by simply ammending the XML package file and adding a package folder to the module's package repository.
